<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Thank you for using Todo-List (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
<p><strong>No Personal Data Collection</strong>: The App does not collect any personal information such as name, email address, or phone number.</p>
<p><strong>Local Data Storage</strong>: All information entered into the App, including your tasks and notes, is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any servers or cloud services.</p>

<h3>Data Collection Methods</h3>
<p>The App operates entirely offline and does not collect any data through internet connections or other online methods.</p>

<h2>Data Use</h2>
<h3>Usage of Collected Data</h3>
<p>Since the App does not collect any personal data, there is no data usage for personal information. All data (tasks, notes) remain on your local device and are used solely for the purpose of managing your tasks.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<h3>Sharing with Third Parties</h3>
<p>The App does not share any data with third parties. All information stays on your local device and is not accessible to anyone else.</p>

<h2>Data Protection</h2>
<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>We ensure that the data stored on your device is protected using standard security measures available on your device. However, as the data is stored locally, it is important to follow best practices for device security, such as using passwords and keeping your device software up to date.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>Data entered into the App will remain on your device until you choose to delete it. Since no data is transmitted or stored externally, we do not have any data retention policies beyond your device's storage.</p>

<h2>User Rights</h2>
<p>You have full control over your data stored in the App. You can add, modify, or delete your tasks and notes at any time directly within the App.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
